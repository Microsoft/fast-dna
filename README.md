# What is FAST-DNA
The acronym stands for fast, adaptive, secure, and timeless. A design network architecture consisting of a set of utilities that can be used to accelerate building for the web. 

Teams often spend significant time building parts of the design system (colors, variable font, typography, structure, accessibility, etc.) that donâ€™t meet industry best practices, standards, or meet the pixel-perfect fidelity required by design. FAST-DNA solves this problem by providing tools to accelerate this process with optimized code that is both performant and accessible. The result works with component frameworks such as (Fabric, MWF, Foundation, etc.) as well as JavaScript frameworks (React, Angular, Vue, etc.).

**How do we accelerate?** A team can use our resources as guidance, reference, fork, or as dependencies.

## Status
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/fast-dna.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/fast-dna)


## Packages
[Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) in [independent mode](https://github.com/lerna/lerna#independent-mode---independent) is used to organize and manage this monorepository and contains utilities each of which are published to NPM. Users can choose one package, some packages, or all of them together as an accelerator to quickly construct enterprise experiences. Highly tuned production code where the hard work has been done already.
