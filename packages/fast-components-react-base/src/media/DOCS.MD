## Best practices
Use *image* to break up text-heavy pages, to illustrate products for sale, or to improve storytelling on a page. The use of *image* should always support the pageâ€™s story and, when possible, contribute to that story. Size the *image* to complement the rest of the page content. Use the **picture** option to employ a selection of image versions for different viewport sizes.

### Usage guidance
Use the [Lifestyle](/getting-started/designing/imagery-lifestyle) and [Product](/getting-started/designing/imagery-product) imagery guidance when choosing your images. Pay attention to guidance for improper usage at the bottom of the Lifestyle and Product imagery pages. Use HTML text instead of putting graphic text in images.

### Style guidance
Don't use *image* as a substitute for *hero*, *feature*, or *product* and *content placements*. Don't use an image if it reduces the effectiveness of the page.

## Accessibility
An image must **always** have an `alt` attribute. Not only does it give the image meaning for non-sighted users, but if the image fails to load, the `alt` text will be displayed instead. Always use descriptive `alt` text that concisely describes what the *image* conveys. Make sure you are communicating what the *image* is telling you visually. If the *image* is purely for visual decoration and does not convey any meaningful information, such as an icon to reinforce adjacent text, then you should set the `alt` attribute to an empty string: `alt=""`. *Images* with complex content (e.g. charts and graphs) may need an additional description for non-sighted users. For example, provide a link to a text description or describe the *image* in detail on the page itself.
