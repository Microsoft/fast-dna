# Divider
The *divider* component defines a thematic break or shift of topic within a page. It is an enhancement of the HTML [hr](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/hr) element.

## Accessibility
The *divider* is intrinsically set as `role="presentation"`, and therefore is not necessary to explicitly include when usage involves changing the look of the page but does not have all the functional, interactive, or structural relevance implied by the `hr` element. When the *divider* separates and distinguishes sections of content or groups of menu items, apply `role="separator"` attribute.
