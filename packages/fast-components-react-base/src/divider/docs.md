## Best practices
Use the *divider* to show a change in the content between two blocks of information. The content surrounding the *divider* determine the spacing above and below it. For example, headings of differing importance require different spacing above them, but it is possible to apply spacing preselects for space above and/or below the *divider*.

### Usage guidance
Use *divider* to separate sections that may not otherwise have a clear beginning or end, and to separate information blocks where the context or continuity changes between the blocks.

### Style guidance
When white space or headings can clearly define new sections, dividers are not needed. They are also not for graphic decoration.

## Accessibility
The *divider* is intrinsically set as `role="presentation"`, and therefore is not necessary to explicitly include when usage involves changing the look of the page but does not have all the functional, interactive, or structural relevance implied by the `hr` element. 
When the *divider* separates and distinguishes sections of content or groups of menu items, apply `role="separator"` attribute.
