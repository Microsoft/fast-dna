The `fast-foundation` package is a library of Web Component classes, templates, and other utilities intended to be composed into registered Web Components by design systems (e.g. Fluent Design, Material Design, etc.). The exports of this package can generally be thought of as un-styled base components that implement semantic and accessible markup and behavior.

This package does not export Web Components registered as [custom elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements) - it exports parts and pieces intended to be *composed* into Web Components, allowing you to implement your own design language by simply applying CSS styles and behaviors without having to write all the JavaScript that's involved in building production-quality component implementations.

## Installation

`npm i --save @microsoft/fast-foundation`
