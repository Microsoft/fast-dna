# Label

A *number field* is a form component which allows users to input and edit numerical data.

## Usage

Use sentence case (e.g. "Last name"), but avoid punctuation such as colons. *Label* text should be short and succinct, not a full sentence. When labeling components, write the *label* text as a noun or a concise noun phrase, without using full sentences. Using commas to separate list items is an exception to this rule.

## Behavioral guidance

Use *number field* when numeric values of input are required. Use step to control number accuracy. It is recommended to have a label above the number field to indicate its usage.
