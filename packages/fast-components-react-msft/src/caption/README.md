# Caption
Caption component can help provide context to images, figures or tables.

## Usage
Caption should be used sparingly. Due to the small fontsize of captions, legibility may suffer, so it should not be used for long descriptions or as a paragraph. It should add informational value without being a distraction. Captions are also used for footnotes or as secondary text to provide additional information.

## Style guidance
There are two levels to caption. Level 1, sets the caption to font size of 10px, and level 2, sets the font size of 11px.
