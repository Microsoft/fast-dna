# Subheading
Use various subheading sizes to create a clear hierarchy within your page. Subheadings are paired with HTML heading elements such as `<h1>` through `<h6>` and `<p>`.

## Usage
Use the appropriate numbered tag for the relative importance of each subheading compared to other subheadings on the page. Subheadings should be descriptive summaries of the content below them. Subheading cannot exist without a heading. Choose a subheading level that best organizes your page content. Then choose the subheading level to meet your design needs. For example, an `<h2>` element does not absolutely require level 2, it could be any of the other levels as well.

## Styleguide
Subheadings are a great way to break up your writing. They improve the layout of a page and draw attention to important points.
