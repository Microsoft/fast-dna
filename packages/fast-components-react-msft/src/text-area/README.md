# Text area 
A *text area* is a form component which allows users to input and edit multi-line textual data.

## Usage guidance
It is recommended to have some sort of hint text inside and/or label above your *text area* to indicate what kind of text input the user should type. Hint text will be styled appropriately. Use a valid label which maps to corresponding *text area* html id attribute.

Behavioral guidance
Use *text area* in conjunction with other elements (e.g. form elements, submit button, etc.) in cases where collection of data is needed. For single-line input, consider using *text field* instead.
