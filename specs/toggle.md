# fast-toggle

## Overview

*Toggle* mimics a physical switch that allows users to turn things **on** or **off**.

### Use Cases

*Toggle* is used to represent a binary state such and **on** or **off**. If any extra step is required for changes to be effective or an indeterminate state is needed, you should use *checkbox* and corresponding "Apply" button instead. Users shouldnâ€™t need to do something else or go somewhere else in order to experience the *Toggle's* effect.

Typical use cases include, but are not limited to turning a feature on and off or showing or hiding a piece of UI
  
### Features

A toggle should allow the following properties. Selected, whether the toggle is selected or not. Selected message, the message that displays when the toggle is selected. Unselected message, the message that displays when toggle is not selected. Disabled, whether the toggle is disabled or not.

### Risks and Challenges

Typically it's best to include a selected and unselected message but it is not required. It's common to see *Toggle* without a message but there are accessibility concerns since it's not necessarily obvious what is **on** and what is **off**. The visual representation of **on** tends to show the state indicator to the right with the background filled and **off** tends to show the state indicator to the left and the background unfilled. However, this pattern is not always consistent.

## Design

*Describe the design of the component, thinking through several perspectives:*

- *A customer using the component on a web page.*
- *A developer building an app with the component and interacting through HTML/CSS/JavaScript.*
- *A designer customizing the component.*

### API

- fast-toggle
- selected, unselected message, selected message, disabled, labelId, statusMessageId
- onChange

### Anatomy and Appearance

<div>
    <label id="toggle-label">Toggle label</label>
    <button role="switch" aria-checked="true" aria-labelledby="toggle-label" aria-describedby="status-message"/>
        <!-- Status Indicator -->
        <span/>
    </button>
    <span id="status-message">On</span>
</div>

## Implementation

<fast-toggle
    selected={true}
    unSelectedMessage="On"
    selectedMessage="Off"
    labelId="label-id"
    statusMessageId="status-id"
>
    Notify by Email
</fast-toggle>

### States

*Toggle* can either be **on** or **off** clicking or keyboard interactions will flip it to its opposite state.

### Accessibility

*Toggle* is a type of checkbox that represents on/off values, as opposed to checked/unchecked values. The *button* should have its role set to *aria-role="switch"* and *aria-checked* should be set to represent the current state of the *Toggle*. *aria-labelledby* should be set to the id of the *Toggle* label and *aria-describedby* should be set to the status message only if values other than "On" and "Off" are passed.

### Globalization

*Toggle* should mirror in RTL languages. 

### Dependencies

*Will implementing the component require taking on any dependencies?*

- *3rd party libraries*
- *Upcoming standards we need to polyfill*
- *Dependencies on other fast components or utilities*

*Do any of these dependencies bring along an associated timeline?*

### Documentation

*What additions or changes are needed for user documentation and demos? Are there any architectural/engineering docs we should create as well, perhaps due to some interesting technical challenge or design decisions related to this component?*
