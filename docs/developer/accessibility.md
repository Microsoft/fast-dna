# Accessibility

FAST-DNA has worked diligently from the ground up to build a component framework that meets all WCAG 2.0 AA standards. Every new component or website revision involves a rigorous approval process to validate and document compliance.

Active collaboration occurs with both Microsoftâ€™s legal, accessibility, and marketing teams to deliver inclusive and accessible experiences.

## Browsers

The base component packages support IE10+ and all modern browsers.

### Reporting browser bugs

* [Edge](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/)
* [Firefox](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/)
* [Safari](https://bugs.webkit.org/)
* [Chrome](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list)
* [Opera](https://bugs.opera.com/wizard/desktop)

## Animation accessibility

* End users should have a mechanism to reduce or remove animations from their experience. The Safari devs have proposed a media query for reduced animation. ("prefers-reduced-motion")
* Some users with vestibular disorders or other cognitive disabilities have problems with movement. A safe fallback for nearly all users is fade animations.
* Flashing animations can cause seizures and should be avoided. Good data on the accessibility of animation is scarce.
