# Install

## Prerequisits

### Setup a development environment

1. Install the latest stable versions of [Git](https://git-scm.com/download).
1. Configure git user credentials for [every respository](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-username-in-git/#setting-your-git-username-for-every-repository-on-your-computer) or [single repository](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-username-in-git/#setting-your-git-username-for-a-single-repository)
1. Install the LTS (Long Term Support) version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en).

### Setup the source repository

Clone the repository, `cd` into the project, install [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) and install dependencies:

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/fast-dna.git
cd fast-dna
npm i --global lerna@3.3.0
npm i
```

Install all Lerna dependencies:

``` shell
lerna bootstrap
```

- `npm run tslint` or `npm run tslint:fix` runs tslint on all typescript in the project.
- `npm run unit-tests` runs all unit-tests.
- `npm run test` runs all processes required to pass prior to check-in. Generally includes building, linting, and unit-testing.

To run these processes across *all* projects, substitute `npm` for `lerna`.

```shell
lerna run test
```

## Understanding packages

All packages can be found [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/fast-dna/tree/master/packages). Each package includes a `readme.md` file at the root that describes how the package can be used.

## Dependencies

Dependencies are purposely limited to simplify the upgrade cycle. Due to the constantly changing nature of web technologies, itâ€™s imperative to update more frequently with less friction and without customer impact.
