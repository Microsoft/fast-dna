## SubscriberSet class

An implementation of Notifier that efficiently keeps track of subscribers interested in a specific change notification on an observable source.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class SubscriberSet implements Notifier 
```

## Remarks

This set is optimized for the most common scenario of 1 or 2 subscribers. With this in mind, it can store a subscriber in an internal field, allowing it to avoid Array\#push operations. If the set ever exceeds two subscribers, it upgrades to an array automatically.
